# Tested on Android 10 to 16.

It works well with these minimal/dumbphone devices:

- Mudita Kompakt
- LightPhone 3 (tested on emulator)
- QIN F22
- Cat S22 flip


# Downloading


You can download the apk directly on the Release section on the rightside of github, or you can use a manager like IzzyOnDroid. It might come on F-Droid in the future once I figure it out.
